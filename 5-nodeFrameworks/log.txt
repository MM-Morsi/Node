apis - http servers 
serve static files 

use WebAPI
create users - serve list of users 

Express - Sails (ORM) - Koa (most modern)

Express.js
* web applications - web api 
* applications: run in the browser + talk to servers 
    - back end and front end both 
* Runs within node (backend) but contributes to both backend and frontend 
* Express has a lot of features - community support

Socket.io
* Server can send request to the client 
* real time - bi directional event based communication 
* Notification from server to client @ events 
* client side and server side libraries --> api 
* event driven 

Static content vs Dynamic content 
* dynamic is served through api 
* serve dynamic web pages (serving on the server itself)

install express with npm 
* to save dependencies --> create package.json
* npm instal -s express
    -s is used to save the package as dependency in the package.json file

To run the server: 
localhost:3000 (3000 is the port number given in app.listen(port-number))

Listen callback
Tell me when the server starts running
port number dynamically:
server = app.listen(3000, callback) and use inside the callback: 
server.address().port
-- app.listen() returns an object with all server and its properties 
-- we can use the object inside the callback before/while its creation ?! How come ?!
---- The object is created and then it's used by the callback in an async matter

app.use(__dirname)
This to serve the index.html and the entire content in the directory (with seevwr.js)
